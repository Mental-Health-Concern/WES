Dear {!Case.Contact},

We are the Counselling Service provided by your Employers. 

Following your recent contact with Insight Wellbeing at Work Iâ€™m writing to say that we hope all is well and to ask if you could please telephone Insight Wellbeing at Work, on {!Account.WAW_Helpline_Number__c}, to speak to one of the Counsellors, if you wish to go ahead with counselling.

Yours sincerely,
